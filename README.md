# My-first-3D-game

This was my second game project at Mediastadi (Helsinki, Finland). It was a 3D game called Sandman.

During this project I've been a Lead Programmer, who was responsible for the game being playable and according to the view of the game designer.
I've been working closely with game lead, game designer and lead artist.

The game was based on the story of Sandman (Nukkumatti), who is jumping on clouds, speaks to pegions and kills nightmares.
After the player kills enemies, there's some loot falling from them that player picks up. There were starts as currency and extra lives.

During this project I learned the pain of my life - animations. I actually was excited to do them and when I got my hands on them - that was painful :D

Anyways, animations for player and , movement, NPCs, camera movement and zoom, shop, enemies loot, particles.
Implementation of 2D and 3D assets as well as textures.

Also for this project I've done a 3D model of a city below the clouds.
